# 🔐 Authentication & RBAC Service

A standalone **authentication and authorization service** built with modern backend and DevOps practices.
It provides **user management, secure authentication (JWT/OAuth2), and role-based access control (RBAC)** that can be reused across microservices.

---

## 📌 Features

* **User Authentication**

  * Sign up / Login / Logout
  * JWT access tokens + refresh tokens
  * Secure password hashing (bcrypt/argon2)
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**

  * Define roles (e.g., `admin`, `editor`, `viewer`)
  * Assign users to roles
  * Protect routes based on role permissions
* **Security Best Practices**

  * Password hashing with salt
  * Token expiration + refresh
  * Token revocation (logout)
  * (Optional) Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
* **API-first**

  * REST endpoints for auth and user management
  * Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
* **Database Integration**

  * PostgreSQL for persistence (users, roles, sessions, audit logs)
  * Migration scripts (Flyway/Liquibase)
* **DevOps Ready**

  * Dockerized for easy deployment
  * CI pipeline (tests, lint, build)
  * Secrets managed via environment variables
  * Metrics (request latency, failed logins) exposed for Prometheus

---

## 🏗️ Tech Stack Recommendations

* **Backend Framework:**

  * **Spring Boot (Java/Kotlin)** or **Node.js (NestJS/Express)**
* **Database:**

  * PostgreSQL (preferred)
  * Redis (optional, for session blacklisting and caching)
* **Authentication:**

  * JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for access control
  * OAuth2.0 (optional extension, e.g., Google login)
* **Containerization:**

  * Docker + Docker Compose
* **DevOps:**

  * GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipeline)
  * Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring
* **Documentation:**

  * Swagger / OpenAPI 3

## 🚀 What This Project Will Do

This service will:

1. Allow users to **register** and **log in** securely.
2. Issue **JWT access tokens** with short expiration and **refresh tokens** with longer expiration.
3. Allow admins to define and manage **roles and permissions**.
4. Enforce **access control** on APIs (e.g., only `admin` can create new users).
5. Log and audit important security events (login attempts, token refresh, failed authentications).
6. Be deployed as a **standalone service** that other microservices can integrate with.

## 🧪 Example API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint             | Description              | Auth Required |
| ------ | -------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------- |
| POST   | `/auth/register`     | Register a new user      | ❌             |
| POST   | `/auth/login`        | Login with credentials   | ❌             |
| POST   | `/auth/refresh`      | Get new access token     | ❌             |
| POST   | `/auth/logout`       | Revoke refresh token     | ✅             |
| GET    | `/users/me`          | Get current user profile | ✅             |
| POST   | `/users/assign-role` | Assign role to a user    | ✅ (admin)     |
| GET    | `/admin/audit-logs`  | View security audit logs | ✅ (admin)     |

## 🛡️ Security Highlights

* Passwords stored with **bcrypt/argon2**, never plain text.
* JWTs signed with **HS256 or RS256**.
* Environment variables used for secrets.
* Rate limiting for login attempts (optional).
* Audit logs for suspicious activities.

---

## 📊 Monitoring

* API metrics exposed at `/metrics` for Prometheus.
* Grafana dashboards for:

  * Login success vs failure rates
  * Token refresh usage
  * Request latency per endpoint

---

## 📝 Roadmap (Optional Extensions)

* [ ] Add OAuth2 login (Google, GitHub).
* [ ] Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA).
* [ ] Add password reset via email.
* [ ] Add role-based UI dashboard (with a small React frontend).
